8.Summarize how firewall filters traffic.
Ans: A firewall filters traffic by applying rules that decide weather to allow or deny the particular Ip Addresses, ports or protocols. It the rule mathces allow, the packet goes through. If rule matches deny/block, the packet is not allowed to go through. If no rule is mentioned, then wither the packet is denied or prompted.
